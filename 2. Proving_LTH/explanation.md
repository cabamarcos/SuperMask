# Proving LTH

In this folder we are trying to prove the existence of lottery tickets for the architectures and datasets we want to exeperiment later on. 

We will also compare the results of this experiment with the experiments done in the folder ./1. Initial resolutions to see if lottery tickets with different levels of sparsity can have better performance than a fully trained net.
